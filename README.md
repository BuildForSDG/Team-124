## About

##Smart City Power Technology
 
##Project Overview
We are building an Application that will compact Power supply issues in Africa. This will be achieved by 
taking data visualization of each street in an area, so one can know which area needs urgent assistance

Creating a means where a user can call the power holding company in cases on emergency.
An avenue where a user can post a particular issue he has.

A user can pay his bills through the App

Power Holding company can comment on a particular post
 
 
##Features 
Admin can signin/signup
User/Customer can signin/signup
Company can signin/signup
User can make a post 
Company can comment
User/Customer can make an emergency call
User/Customer can make payment

## Why

Major cities in Africa has indeed been plagued with unstable Electrical Power Supply challenge which has hindered its growth economically tremendously. We hope to create a solution that will provide help to the ugly scene.  

## Usage



## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.
